# My Library

A responsive reading companion built with React, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui. The app curates markdown notes about books you have finished, are currently reading, or want to pick up next. Content is generated at build time from the markdown files in `content/books` and rendered across the following views:

- **My Books** – full collection with tag filtering, library stats, and a quick search.
- **Finished** – ratings-first view with markdown reviews rendered in-place.
- **Wishlist** – titles you hope to read soon with context notes.
- **Favorites** – the books you recommend most often.
