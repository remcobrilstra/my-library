## A delightful return to hard sci-fi

Andy Weir is at his best when he strands a scientist in an impossible situation. *Project Hail Mary* doubles down on that formula with earnest characters, clever problem solving, and a surprisingly heartfelt friendship.

- Lots of crunchy science without getting bogged down.
- The pacing never lets up even on a re-read.
- The ending left me grinning for days.
